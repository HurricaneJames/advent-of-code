# Advent of Code 2022
https://adventofcode.com/2022/

This was my first year doing AOC. I used the problems as a way to improve my typescript skills. In the JS realm, I have mostly used flow, so it was interesting to compare the two. The first few days I was solving the problems quickly with little thought to readable code. Towards the end, I was a better engineer and writing clearer code. Overall, it was a fun year... aside from day 16. Day 16 really needs access to things like bit arrays to run in a reasonable amount of time.
